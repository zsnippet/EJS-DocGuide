# EJS Partials and Styling

In this document, we will explore the concepts of layouts, partials, and templating using EJS (Embedded JavaScript). The focus will be on handling styling in server-side development, ensuring that static files like CSS are incorporated seamlessly into the project.

## Static Files and Express Middleware

When working with styles and static files like CSS and images, it's important to distinguish between dynamic and static content. Unlike dynamic content, static files remain unchanged and can be stored in a designated `"public"` folder. To let the server know about the location of these static files, Express middleware called `express.static()` is used.

### Example Middleware Setup for Static Files

Here's how you can set up the middleware to handle static files in your Express application:

```javascript
// Example middleware setup for static files in server.js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

In this example, the `express.static('public')` middleware informs Express that static files can be found in the "public" folder.

### Referencing Static Files in EJS Templates

Once the middleware is set up, you can reference static files in your EJS templates by specifying their paths relative to the "public" folder.

### Example Linking to a Stylesheet in EJS

For instance, if you have a stylesheet named "layout.css" in the "styles" subfolder of "public," you can link to it in your EJS template like this:

```html
<!-- Example link to a stylesheet in index.ejs -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/layout.css">
```

Here, the `href="/styles/layout.css"` specifies the path relative to the "public" folder, making it easy to include static files in your dynamic templates.

Below is a hierarchical tree structure representing the file organization for the above example:

```
project-root
│
├── public
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── layout.css
│   │
│   └── other-static-files
│
├── views
│   ├── index.ejs
│   
└── server.js
```

## EJS Partials for Code Reusability

As projects grow, maintaining clean and efficient code becomes crucial. EJS partials offer a solution by enabling the inclusion of reusable components, like headers and footers, across multiple pages.

### Example Usage of EJS Partials in `index.ejs`

Here's how you can use EJS partials in your `index.ejs` file:

```html
<!-- Example usage of EJS partials in index.ejs -->
<%- include('partials/header.ejs') %>
<!-- Main content of the page goes here -->
<%- include('partials/footer.ejs') %>
```

In this example, the `<%- include('partials/header.ejs') %>` line includes the content of the "header.ejs" partial file, and similarly, the `<%- include('partials/footer.ejs') %>` line includes the content of the "footer.ejs" partial file.

### Inclusion Path

The inclusion path is always relative to the `"views"` folder, maintaining consistency with how EJS files are generally rendered in Express applications.

Using EJS partials not only enhances code reusability but also simplifies the process of updating shared components across various pages in your project.

Below is a hierarchical tree structure representing the file organization for the above example:

```
project-root
│
├── public
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── layout.css
│   └── other-static-files
│
├── views
│   ├── index.ejs
│   ├── partials
│   │   ├── header.ejs
│   │   └── footer.ejs
│   └── ...
│
└── server.js
```
