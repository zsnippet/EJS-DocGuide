# Templating with EJS

## What is Templating?

Templating is a technique used in web development to generate HTML dynamically. Instead of writing HTML directly in your code, you create templates with placeholders for dynamic data. These templates are then filled in with data during runtime to generate the final HTML content that is sent to the client's browser.

## Why EJS?

**EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** is a popular templating engine for Node.js and web applications. It allows developers to embed JavaScript code directly into their HTML templates, making it easy to generate dynamic content. Some reasons why EJS is preferred by developers include:

It offers several advantages for developers:

- **Familiar Syntax:** EJS uses a syntax similar to HTML and JavaScript, making it straightforward for developers already familiar with these languages.
  
- **Versatility:** EJS can handle a wide range of templating tasks, from simple variable substitution to complex logic and control flow.

- **Active Community:** With a large and active community of developers, EJS provides ample resources, support, and third-party libraries to extend its functionality.

- **Integration with Express:** EJS seamlessly integrates with Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, making it convenient for building dynamic web applications.

## EJS Fundamentals: Tags, Data Parsing, Partials, and Layouts 

### 1. Tags

EJS provides several tags for embedding JavaScript code and controlling template flow:
- `<% %>`: Executes JavaScript code without outputting anything.
- `<%= %>`: Outputs the result of evaluating a JavaScript expression into the template.
- `<%- %>`: Outputs the result of evaluating a JavaScript expression into the template, with HTML encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

These tags enable the dynamic generation of HTML content based on the data and logic in your application.

### 2. Parsing Data

EJS allows easy parsing of data from the backend server and incorporating it into templates. This enables the creation of dynamic pages that display different content based on user input or database queries.

### 3. Partials and Layouts

Partials are smaller, reusable components of a web page, such as headers, footers, or sidebars. EJS supports including partial templates within main templates, simplifying code reuse and maintaining consistency across the application.
